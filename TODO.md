# clinosim — TODO

## Status (current as of 2026-06-22)

**v0.2 (Simulation realism + Japanese/English documents + Occupational injuries)** — population-driven simulation with full FHIR R4 Bulk Data Export, multi-country (US/JP), 32 diseases + 46 ED/outpatient conditions, occupational injury support (6 work-related conditions + occupation field), snapshot date support, pluggable LLM providers (Ollama/Bedrock/Mock), three-stage CLI pipeline (`generate` → `narrate` → `export-fhir`), FHIR DocumentReference for 5 clinical document types (Tier A+B) in English and Japanese.

Latest generated datasets:

US full run (40K catchment, 50-bed hospital, seed=42):
- 102,485 encounters (1,501 inpatient + 96,114 outpatient + 5,029 ED)
- 3,344 Bedrock EN narrative documents (1,501 H&P + 1,501 DC + 181 Proc + 97 Op + 64 Death)
- 15 in-progress encounters (snapshot date)
- FHIR Bulk Data 2.0GB, 14 resource types (+ FamilyMemberHistory) + DocumentReference, 0 ID violations

JP full run (5K catchment, 50-bed hospital, seed=42):
- 16,637 encounters (227 inpatient + 15,886 outpatient + 524 ED)
- 499 Bedrock JP narrative documents

- 420 unit + 80 integration + 39 e2e tests passing

**AD-55 Base data-enrichment roadmap complete (2026-06):** microbiology, cardiac
markers, nursing flowsheets, immunization, family history, code status, extended
SDOH (smoking/alcohol/JP 要介護度). The FHIR adapter was split from one 3015-line
monolith into per-theme `_fhir_*` builder modules (FA-1, byte-identical). See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-22-data-quality-audit.md` (clean).

**AKI Cr / DKA HCO3 surgical calibration (PR #69, 2026-06-22):** Two coefficients
in `derive_lab_values()` (Cr low-renal slope 15→6.5, HCO3 metabolic-axis gain
24→31) shift AKI admit Cr p50 from ESRD-domain (~5.6 US / 7.9 JP) into the KDIGO
2-3 band (~3.3 US / 4.1 JP), and DKA admit HCO3 / pH into ADA-stratified bands,
while leaving every state variable and disease YAML at master. BNP-pattern
surgical fix (#28 / #62): byte-diff at US/JP p=2000 seed=42 confirms only
`Observation.ndjson` differs and patient cohorts are preserved exactly. See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-22-aki-dka-surgical-calibration-audit.md` (byte-diff +
percentile audit) and `docs/reviews/2026-06-22-aki-dka-surgical-calibration-data-quality-review.md`
(post-calibration FHIR/CIF data-quality review, clean).

**BNP wall-stress historical-record + I50 cohort decomposition (PR #70/#71,
2026-06-22):** The BNP wall-stress formula (already landed in commits
`ac36ff63` / `1c22a3e6` on 2026-06-20) gets its spec + plan committed as
design history (PR #70). The "I50 admit BNP below ADHF band" item from the
PR #69 review is closed: decomposing the I50 cohort by
`condition_event.ground_truth_diseases` + `encounter_type` shows inpatient
+ heart_failure_exacerbation admits at BNP p50 = 603.6 US / 931.8 JP (inside
the ADHF 800-1500 band) and outpatient chronic-I50 follow-up at p50 = 68.6
US / 74.9 JP (correctly mild for compensated HF). The mixed-cohort p50 was
a grouping artifact, not a formula deficiency (PR #71). See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-22-i50-bnp-cohort-decomposition.md`.

**FHIR DiagnosticReport panel grouping (PR #72, 2026-06-23):** Post-hoc
grouping of existing lab Observations into FHIR `DiagnosticReport`
resources for 7 panels (CBC / BMP / LFT / Lipid / Coag / UA / ABG) with
authoritative LOINC codes (`58410-2 / 51990-0 / 24325-3 / 57698-3 /
24373-3 / 24356-8 / 24338-6`). Implemented as a new AD-56-registered
bundle builder (`build_lab_panel_reports`) reading `ctx.record["orders"]`
and emitting one DR per (panel, encounter, day) with `result[]`
referencing the existing Observation ids. No CIF schema change, no
observation-engine change, no new RNG. Byte-diff at US/JP p=2000 seed=42
preserves every non-DR NDJSON identically; every existing microbiology
DR record is preserved byte-identically as a complete JSON line.
Referential integrity: 4025 US + 3502 JP panel DRs with 0 dangling
references. Audit at US p=8000 / JP p=4000 yields ~15k panel DRs
(LFT 5510 + CBC 5324 + ABG 2581 + BMP 2189 + Lipid 54 + microbiology 160
on US). Two calibrations to simulator emission (vs spec) documented:
day-resolution bucket (vs minute — the lab generator randomizes
per-component timing) and lowered `min_components` (Hct/Cl/Ca absent
from current physiology engine). See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-22-diagnostic-report-panels-audit.md`.

**CBC / BMP panel registry + panel-children RNG isolation (PR #74,
2026-06-23):** Two structural changes shipped together because PR #72's
calibration comments misdiagnosed the gap. (1) `lab_panels.yaml` gains
`CBC: [WBC, Hb, Hct, Plt]` and `BMP: [Na, K, Cl, HCO3, BUN, Creatinine,
Glucose, Ca]` entries so 9 silently-dropped `{test:"CBC"}` /
`{test:"BMP"}` orders in cerebral_infarction / DVT / hemorrhagic_stroke
/ DKA finally emit their canonical children — including **Hct, which
the engine already derived but had no emission path** (US count 3 →
114, 38×). (2) `_run_daily_loop` splits the lab-resulting loop into
Pass 1 (master RNG, non-panel-child orders — byte-identical to master)
and Pass 2 (panel children, per-parent isolated sub-RNG seeded by
`panel_specimen_seed(parent_order_id)` in the new `simulator/seeding.py`
helper). This closes a latent AD-16 violation that PR #72's emission
profile would have widened, and converts specimen rejection from
per-analyte (clinically impossible — pH rejected while pCO2 from the
same draw is fine) to per-specimen (one parent → all-or-nothing on
children). Cohort drift on non-lab files within the structural-fix
band; data-quality preserved (refRange 100%, display ≠ code 100%).
See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-23-cbc-bmp-panel-expansion-design.md`
and `docs/reviews/2026-06-23-cbc-bmp-byte-diff.md`.

**CBC / BMP min_components raise + cerebral_infarction redundancy
removal (PR #75, 2026-06-23):** Audit-driven follow-up to PR #74.
`lab_panel_groups.yaml` raises `CBC.min_components` 2 → 3 and
`BMP.min_components` 3 → 5 per the canonical-N − 1 rule (one
specimen-handling tolerance). Validated by a new audit script
(`scratchpad/cbc_bmp_panel_audit.py`) at US p=4000 showing the
5th-percentile floor of "panel-order-placed" days sits at the
canonical maximum (4 / 6) — large margin above the chosen
thresholds. Headline outcome: **CBC DR count drops 81 % (1466 → 274)
and BMP DR 48 % (673 → 350) on US p=2000** as the new thresholds
suppress coincidence-only groupings. `cerebral_infarction.yaml` lines
139-140 lose their redundant `{test:"Hb"}` / `{test:"Plt"}` orders
(pre-PR1 workaround now superseded by the CBC panel's children).
Two existing DR-grouping unit tests expanded so their component
counts continue to clear the new thresholds. See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-23-cbc-bmp-pr2-audit.md`.

**Post-PR #75 data-quality review + JP lab localization fix (PR #76,
2026-06-23):** 3-axis review at US p=10000 + JP p=5000 (seed=42).
Structural quality perfect on both populations (zero duplicate ids,
zero unresolved references across 9.1 M + 1.1 M reference checks,
refRange 100 %, display ≠ code 100 %). Clinical fidelity 13 / 14
PASS on both (CKD SKIP is structural — chronic_followup cohort outside
the inpatient walk); every per-disease admit-day band lands in the
clinically expected range. JP localization: US bundle byte-clean of
Japanese characters, JP `Condition.code.text` and `DiagnosticReport.code`
display 100 % Japanese, JP CM-granular ICD-10 leaks zero. One defect
detected and fixed in the same PR: five JLAC10 entries (3B015 CK-MB,
3B035 AST, 3B045 ALT, 4A055 TSH, 5C070 CRP) had `ja` populated with
the English abbreviation rather than the JCCLS Japanese name — replaced
with the JSLM v137 canonical names. See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-23-pr75-data-quality-review.md` and
`scratchpad/dqr_pr75_review.py`.

**Phase 2a — D-dimer (LOINC 48065-7 / JLAC10 2B140) + causes_vte flag
+ J5 wiring fix (2026-06-24):** Activates the D-dimer analyte by
extending `physiology.derive_lab_values` with a multi-axis formula +
a new `causes_vte` scenario flag (AD-57 BNP-pattern surgical, no new
`PhysiologicalState` field):

  age_factor = max(0, age - 50) * 0.005
  D_dimer = clamp(0.3 + age_factor + infl*0.5 + coag*1.5
                  + (4.0 if causes_vte else 0), 0.15, 20.0)

Three disease YAMLs gain `causes_vte: true`: pulmonary_embolism,
deep_vein_thrombosis, cerebral_infarction (embolic stroke). NOT
hemorrhagic_stroke (intracerebral fibrinolysis is captured by
coagulation_status alone). NOT AF / sepsis / COPD / acute_mi that
order D-dimer to screen — their elevation should stay non-specific.

**Improvement J5 bundled (same PR)**: introduces
`physiology.engine.scenario_flags_from_protocol(protocol)` helper and
replaces hardcoded `myocardial_injury=...` named arguments at every
`derive_lab_values` call site with `**flags`. Pre-J5, only
`inpatient.py:559-560` (Pass-1 daily loop) read `causes_myocardial_injury`;
emergency.py and outpatient.py passed nothing — so MI patients
presenting through the ED produced type-2 troponin only. The new
`causes_vte` would have replicated this gap if simply added. The fix
is structural (one helper, four sites) and future-proofs additional
scenario flags. Outpatient explicitly passes `None` to pin the
"acute scenario flags don't apply to chronic follow-ups" intent.

Authoritative codes:
- LOINC 48065-7 "Fibrin D-dimer FEU [Mass/volume] in PPP" — NLM
  verified (the spec/plan candidate 30240-9 did not exist; replaced
  with the authoritative FEU code matching locale reference range)
- JLAC10 2B140 "D-Dダイマー" — JSLM v137 sheet 「分析物コード」 verified,
  JCCLS-official ja per PR #76 rule

Byte-diff vs master `b6bc8eab` @ p=2000 seed=42 (both US and JP):
9 NDJSONs (Patient/Encounter/Condition/Medication*/Procedure/
Imaging/Immunization/FamilyHistory) byte-identical; only Observation
changes (+65 US / +15 JP, all D-dimer); DR unchanged (D-dimer is
panel-external to Coag LOINC 24373-3). 3-axis DQR (US p=10000 +
JP p=5000) all PASS — structural / clinical (PE/DVT/cerebral_infarction
D-dimer p50 4.45-4.91 ug/mL FEU, sepsis non-specific p50 0.84-0.90) /
JP language. See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-24-phase2a-vte-data-quality-review.md`,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-24-phase2a-vte-d-dimer-design.md`,
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-phase2a-vte-d-dimer.md`.

Phase 2a deferred backlog → carried forward:
- I4 panel-YAML unification refactor
- I6 `clinical_course.actions[].test` field disambiguation
- I7 `platelet_status` axis independence
- D-dimer LOS-mid analysis (cohort-level DIC trajectory)

**Phase 2b — `on_warfarin` medication-physiology coupling for PT_INR
therapeutic range (2026-06-24):** Extends Phase 2a by coupling warfarin
medication state to PT_INR derivation, completing the admit → ramp →
discharge → outpatient followup cohort trajectory for VTE / AF /
embolic-CI patients.

Sibling helper `medication_flags_from_context(patient, medication_orders,
admission_date, current_day)` parallel to `scenario_flags_from_protocol`.
Detection rules:
1. Chronic warfarin: `patient.current_medications` contains warfarin /
   ワルファリン / coumadin substring (chronic AF I48 + post-VTE I26 /
   I82 / I63 via `chronic_medications.yaml`)
2. In-hospital warfarin: a medication order with warfarin in display_name
   ordered ≥ 3 days ago (loading-dose 3-day rule, `all_orders` peek)

`derive_lab_values` PT_INR block:

  base_inr = 1.0 + (1 - hepatic) * 2.0 + state.coagulation_status * 1.5
  PT_INR = 2.5 + (base_inr - 1.0) * 0.5  if on_warfarin else base_inr

DOAC (apixaban / rivaroxaban / edoxaban / dabigatran) intentionally
NOT detected — INR is not clinically monitored for DOAC, and modeling
DOAC INR lift would be clinically misleading.

YAML data: `chronic_medications.yaml` gains 3 indications — I26 PE
(DOAC 80% / warfarin 20%), I82 DVT (same), I63 embolic CI (60% AC +
70% antiplatelet — combined therapy reflects clinical practice).
`helpers.py` `chronic_prefixes = ("I", ...)` already covers all three.

Byte-diff vs master `9e0b97a7` @ p=2000 seed=42 (US/JP): 8 of 9 NDJSONs
sha256-identical (Patient/Encounter/Condition/MedicationRequest/
MedicationAdministration/Procedure/Immunization/FamilyMemberHistory +
DR). Observation same-count change (199,492 US / 163,662 JP lines
preserved; 40/366 US PT_INR values shifted across 13 encounters, all
upward — warfarin lifting INR into therapeutic).

3-axis DQR (US p=10000 + JP p=5000) all PASS — structural (refRange
100%, code lookup LOINC 6301-6 + JLAC10 2B030) / clinical (US warfarin
p50 INR 2.70 therapeutic, DOAC p50 1.80 ≈ no-AC p50 1.70 unshifted,
warfarin shifted +1.00 above no-AC; JP warfarin p50 3.00 mirror) / JP
language (US 0 JP chars, JP warfarin ワルファリン + PT_INR
プロトロンビン時間 intact). See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-24-phase2b-anticoagulation-data-quality-review.md`,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-24-phase2b-on-anticoagulation-design.md`,
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-phase2b-on-anticoagulation.md`.

CLAUDE.md new architecture rule: `derive_lab_values` reads TWO flag
dicts (scenario + medication); call sites merge via
`{**scenario_flags, **medication_flags}` and splat as `**flags`. Never
add a `flag=value` named arg directly at a call site (J5-prevention
extended).

Phase 2c backlog (anticoagulation deepening):
- aPTT / heparin therapeutic monitoring (UFH IV drip → aPTT 60-80s target)
- DOAC INR micro-effect (rivaroxaban 0.2-0.3 lift) — clinical practice
  ignores, low realism gain, YAGNI
- Warfarin linear ramp (day 1 → 5 continuous vs step at day 3)
- HIT modeling (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, PLT < 50% baseline
  after day 4 of heparin)
- Vitamin K reversal (PCC / FFP infusion drops INR within hours)
- Activator AC-drug exclusivity (warfarin OR apixaban, not both —
  pre-existing independent-probability draw limitation)

**AD-55 Module Foundation Refactor PR1 (G1 structural DRY) — 2026-06-24:**
Mechanical refactor preparing clean foundation for device + HAI feature
modules (chosen first AD-55 Module from brainstorming session 13).
Three structural-DRY items consolidated:

- `_get(obj, name, default)` 6-way duplication -> `clinosim/modules/_shared.py:get_attr_or_key`
  (5 enrichers + 1 FHIR builder import with `as _get` alias; -30 lines duplicate code)
- 7-module sub-seed offsets -> `clinosim/simulator/seeding.py:ENRICHER_SEED_OFFSETS`
  central registry (identity 540_054 + microbiology 770_077 grandfathered as
  decimals; immunization 0x494D / code_status 0x4353 / family_history 0x4648 /
  care_level 0x434C / nursing 0x4E55 use 16-bit hex ASCII convention)
- `care_level.load_rates(country: str = "JP")` signature unified with
  immunization / family_history / code_status + preserved @lru_cache

Convention docs locked in: CLAUDE.md "AD-55 enricher patterns" subsection +
docs/CONTRIBUTING-modules.md 3 sub-section edits (sub-seed registry, shared
helper, locale signature regulation).

Byte-diff vs master `dcb47ccc` @ p=2000 seed=42: all 11 NDJSON sha256-IDENTICAL
for both US and JP (pure mechanical refactor; numerical identity preserved
through registry). test_seeding.py precomputed-literal pins (914786652 /
914785364 / 2694613518) continue to pass as cross-check. See
`scratchpad/refactor_pr1_byte_diff_results.md`.

Series context: PR1 of 4 (G1 done) → PR2 (G2 SDOH integrity done) → PR3
(G3 `_fhir_observations.py` theme split done) → PR_docs (G4 absorbed
done) → next: device + HAI feature work (2 modules with cross-module
enricher consumption).

**AD-55 Module Foundation Refactor PR2 (G2 SDOH integrity) — 2026-06-24:**
Mechanical SDOH integrity refactor preparing for future SDOH expansion
(occupation / education / housing / food insecurity). Three items:

1. 6 SNOMED enum->code mappings (3 smoking + 3 alcohol) moved from
   Python dict hardcode in _fhir_sdoh.py to YAML in new lightweight
   `clinosim/modules/sdoh/` module ("data-only module variant" —
   reference data + loader only, no enricher / no ENRICHER_SEED_OFFSETS;
   `clinosim/codes/` is the preexisting precedent).
2. `_fhir_sdoh.py` 88-line file split into `_fhir_smoking_alcohol.py`
   (LOINC-keyed pattern) + `_fhir_care_level.py` (JP-only, custom code
   system). `_fhir_sdoh.py` deleted.
3. `_social_category` + `_value` helpers promoted to `_fhir_common.py`
   for future SDOH builder reuse (occupation / education / housing /
   food insecurity will inherit).

CONTRIBUTING-modules.md gains "データ専用モジュール (variant)" sub-section
documenting the new module shape. DESIGN.md AD-56 entry extended.

Byte-diff vs master `36ac9afd` @ p=2000 seed=42: all 11 NDJSON
sha256-IDENTICAL for both US and JP (pure mechanical refactor;
numerical identity preserved through YAML). See
`scratchpad/refactor_pr2_byte_diff_results.md`.

Series context: PR2 of 4 (G2 done) → PR3 (G3 done) → PR_docs (G4
absorbed, done) → next: device + HAI feature work.

**Comprehensive Documentation Update (G4 absorbed) — 2026-06-24:**
Pure documentation PR (no code changes; no byte-diff / DQR required).
Five-fold improvement to first-time-viewer onboarding + module-
relationship visibility:

1. **MODULES.md** (new top-level) — 22-module inventory + dependency
   tree + 3 typical call chains + 5-step new-module quick-start.
2. **SCENARIO_FLAGS.md** (new top-level) — central reference for all
   scenario + medication flags routed through derive_lab_values
   (currently myocardial_injury / causes_vte / on_warfarin) + helper
   architecture + 5-step new-flag guide.
3. **.github/TEMPLATE_MODULE_README.md** (new) — standardized template
   for new module READMEs with canonical section order.
4. **All 22 module READMEs gained `## Consumers` section** — reverse-
   dependency visibility (impact tier core/medium/guard) so contributors
   can assess downstream impact of any module change. 4 batches (A:
   small / B: small-medium / C: medium / D: large).
5. **7 weak READMEs** gained `## データ構造` section (disease/encounter/
   order/facility/procedure/validator/population; population already
   had one and was skipped).

Additional fixes:
- `output/README.md` gained "拡張方法 (Extensibility) 総合ガイド" section
  (register_bundle_builder + register_output_adapter patterns + common
  helper list documented).
- `sdoh/README.md` language consistency fix (line 3 was English).
- `CONTRIBUTING-modules.md` gained "PR 検証ガイド: byte-diff vs 3-axis
  DQR" sub-section — clarifies that the TRUE goal is FHIR R4 / JP Core
  compliance + 臨床整合性 + JP language quality; byte-diff is a
  refactor-PR no-regression mechanic only. Captures user feedback:
  "byte-diffってなんのため？CIFにある情報は、適切にFHIRやJP COREに
  準拠したFHIR R4にするのがゴールだよ？"
- `CONTRIBUTING-modules.md` typed-field-vs-extensions decision tree
  extended (G4 doctrine docs absorbed): 3-question judgment flow +
  decision matrix table + PR2 data-only variant lesson.
- Cross-reference integration: README EN/JP gain Module Map section;
  DESIGN.md AD-56 extended with PR_docs note; CLAUDE.md gets new
  "Quick navigation" table at top; CONTRIBUTING-modules.md header
  link directs new contributors to TEMPLATE + MODULES + PR verification.

Series context: PR1 (G1, merged) + PR2 (G2, merged) + **PR_docs (G4
absorbed, merged) ✓** + **PR3 (G3 Observation-family split, this PR) ✓**.
**AD-55 Module Foundation Refactor series complete** — next: device +
HAI feature work.

**AD-55 Module Foundation Refactor PR3 (G3 Observation-family split) — 2026-06-24:**
Pure mechanical refactor — the final structural piece of the foundation
refactor series. Three items:

1. `_fhir_observations.py` (727 lines / 31 KB) decomposed into three
   new per-theme files matching PR2's precedent:
   - `_fhir_microbiology.py` (~110 lines) — Specimen + Observation +
     DiagnosticReport (`_bb_microbiology`), plus the file-private
     `_SUSCEPTIBILITY_DISPLAY` constant.
   - `_fhir_nursing.py` (~210 lines) — NEWS2 / GCS / Braden / Morse /
     Barthel / I&O survey Observations (`_build_nursing_observations`).
   - `_fhir_immunization.py` (~70 lines) — CVX Immunization
     (`_build_immunizations`).
2. Residual `_fhir_observations.py` (~380 lines) is now the canonical
   numeric Observation builder (lab helper + vital builder); module
   docstring trimmed to reflect the final scope; three unused imports
   (`_micro_coding`, `_loinc_coding`, `_survey_category`) and now-unused
   `BundleContext` pruned.
3. `fhir_r4_adapter.py` import block rewired: `_build_immunizations` from
   `_fhir_immunization`, `_bb_microbiology` + `_SUSCEPTIBILITY_DISPLAY`
   from `_fhir_microbiology`, `_build_nursing_observations` from
   `_fhir_nursing`, and only `_build_lab_observation` +
   `_build_vital_observations` from `_fhir_observations`. Down-stream
   re-export surface preserved via `noqa: F401` (every existing
   `from ...fhir_r4_adapter import X` keeps working).

No `_fhir_common.py` helper promotion needed (PR2 already promoted
what was required). `_BUNDLE_BUILDERS` registration order unchanged
(byte-diff prerequisite).

Byte-diff vs master `0ed65f86` @ p=2000 seed=42: **all 33 NDJSON files
(US 16 + JP 17) sha256-IDENTICAL** for both countries. pytest
`unit or integration` 604 passed. See `scratchpad/pr3_byte_diff_results.md`.

DESIGN.md AD-56 entry extended with PR3 continuation. CLAUDE.md output
directory description unchanged (the "per-theme `_fhir_*` builders"
phrasing already covered the new files). `output/README.md`
Extensibility section's per-theme builder table updated with the three
new files + residual `_fhir_observations.py`.

Clears the runway for device + HAI feature builders to land in clean
per-theme files (`_fhir_device.py` / `_fhir_hai.py`) without inheriting
a multi-theme blob.

**Device module (PR-A) — 2026-06-24:** First phase of the 4-PR device +
HAI series. `modules/device/` post_records enricher emits FHIR Device +
DeviceUseStatement for ICU encounters with state-based placement
criteria:

- CVC (SNOMED 52124006) when severity_moderate_plus (ICU inpatient)
- Indwelling catheter (SNOMED 23973005) when severity_moderate_plus OR
  altered_consciousness (vital_signs[i].gcs_score < 13)
- Ventilator (SNOMED 706172005) when hypoxia (perfusion_status < 0.4)
  OR high_respiratory_demand (respiratory_fraction > 0.7)

SNOMED codes verified via tx.fhir.org $expand text-search; spec's
tentative 467021000 was not in SNOMED CT International — replaced
with the verified 23973005 (PR #80 LOINC 2B010 fabrication precedent).
ENRICHER_SEED_OFFSETS["device"] = 0x4445 ("DE"). New
`clinosim/types/device.py` (`DeviceRecord` dataclass under
`extensions["device"]`). `_fhir_device.py` builder file emits Device +
DeviceUseStatement via _BUNDLE_BUILDERS list (PR3 theme-per-file
pattern). 3-axis DQR PASS at US p=10000 + JP p=5000: 353 + 20 devices,
all structural checks 100%, line-days p50 = 6 (US) / 13 (JP) within
plausible bands. byte-diff supplement confirms zero regression on
pre-existing NDJSON. See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-24-device-module-data-quality-review.md`.

Series context: PR-A (✓ done) → PR-B (✓ done) → PR-C (helper
DRY if needed) → PR-D (comprehensive docs sync). Phase 1 simplifications
acknowledged in DQR doc: ICU sub-period ≈ inpatient encounter LOS
(over-estimates true line-days, calibratable in Phase 2); CVC + catheter
always co-emit on ICU inpatient (criteria overlap by design); ventilator
adoption ~82% of CVC (hypoxia proxy broader than true clinical need).

**HAI module (PR-B) — 2026-06-24:** Phase 2 of the 4-PR device + HAI
series. `modules/hai/` post_records enricher (order=80, after
device=70) consumes PR-A `extensions["device"]` line-days and samples
CLABSI/CAUTI/VAP onsets via CDC NHSN baseline per-line-day risk
rates (0.0010 / 0.0014 / 0.0015 per device-day = 1.0/1.4/1.5 per
1000 device-days):

- CLABSI ← CVC (SNOMED 736442006 verified)
- CAUTI ← indwelling catheter (SNOMED 68566005 verified, generic
  UTI — CAUTI-specificity in ICD-10-CM T83.511A + text)
- VAP ← ventilator (SNOMED 429271009 verified)

Onset: cumulative `1 - (1 - per_day_risk)^line_days`; offset uniform
over `[2, line_days)` per CDC ≥48h rule; snapshot in-progress device
→ conservative `line_days=7`. Organism sampled from CDC NHSN top
organism distribution per HAI type (S. aureus / E. coli / Candida /
S. epidermidis / etc., 11 organism SNOMEDs total — 6 reused from PR3
microbiology section, 5 new for HAI). Culture appended to
`record.microbiology` so the existing `_fhir_microbiology.py` builder
emits Specimen + Observation + DiagnosticReport without new wiring.

ENRICHER_SEED_OFFSETS["hai"] = 0x4841 ("HA"). Codes verified at
Task 1: NLM ICD-10-CM API (T80.211A / T83.511A / J95.851); WHO ICD-10
(T80.2 / T83.5 / J95.8); tx.fhir.org $lookup/$expand for SNOMED HAI +
organisms + specimens; existing PR3 microbiology section reused for
LOINC 600-7 / 630-4 / 619-7 (blood / urine / sputum culture). New
`clinosim/types/hai.py` (HAIEvent under `extensions["hai"]`). New
`_fhir_hai.py` builder file emits only the HAI Condition (dual coding
ICD-10 + SNOMED). 3-axis DQR PASS at US p=10000 + JP p=5000: US 4
HAI (3 CAUTI + 1 VAP) within Poisson 2σ of expected ~3.2; JP 0 HAI
acceptable rare event at p=5000 (P(X=0) ≈ 0.71). byte-diff supplement:
all 37 pre-existing NDJSON byte-identical. See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-24-hai-module-data-quality-review.md`.

Series context: PR-A (✓ done) → PR-B (this, ✓ done) → PR-C (helper
DRY if needed) → PR-D (comprehensive docs). Phase 2 simplifications:
snapshot in-progress fallback line_days=7; at-most-one HAI per device;
no antibiotic / susceptibility / mortality / WBC-CRP lift (all Phase 3).

First clean implementation of cross-module enricher consumption pattern
(PR-A device → PR-B hai); foundation for Phase 3+ device-consuming
modules.

**Phase 3a HAI WBC + CRP forward-delta lift — 2026-06-25 (✓ done)**:
Closes the clinical chain HAI 発症 → 炎症マーカー上昇 left open by
PR-B. Adds new `POST_ENCOUNTER` enricher stage to
`simulator/enrichers.py` (alongside `POST_POPULATION` and
`POST_RECORDS`) which runs per-encounter immediately after the daily
loop completes, inside the encounter simulator. Migrates `device`
(order=70) + `hai` (order=80) from POST_RECORDS to POST_ENCOUNTER —
their sampling depends on icu_transferred + GCS + perfusion which
are only known after the loop, and their output (HAI events) is then
consumed by `clinosim/modules/hai/lab_lift.apply_hai_lab_lift` which
walks `extensions["hai"]` and adds a forward-delta to existing
WBC + CRP `obs.value` using per-day state_history snapshots
(`delta = derive(state, lift>0) - derive(state, lift=0)`, preserving
original noise + circadian). New `clinosim/modules/hai/reference_data/
hai_lab_lift.yaml`: CDC severity proxy CLABSI/VAP=0.35, CAUTI=0.20,
ramp_peak_days=2.

The `derive_lab_values` signature gains one new kwarg
`hai_inflammation_lift: float = 0.0` (routed only to CRP + WBC via
`effective_infl = min(1.0, infl + lift)`). PCT / Albumin / Fibrinogen /
pO2 / Ca / Temperature / SBP-DBP continue to read
`state.inflammation_level` directly — Phase 3a scope guard, Phase 3c
will revisit.

AD-55 Module classification refined:
**"encounter-bound Module"** (device/hai — POST_ENCOUNTER) vs
**"cross-record Module"** (nursing/immunization/family_history/
code_status/care_level/sdoh — POST_RECORDS). byte-diff PASS: 37/37
NDJSON byte-identical at US p=2000 + JP p=2000 (HAI Poisson rare at
this size; lift verified by closed-form proof script — see post-fix
DQR review).

**xhigh code review hardening (PR-90, 2026-06-25 second pass)**:
A workflow-backed xhigh review on the merged PR-90 surfaced 13
confirmed + 2 plausible bugs. The critical one: YAML hai_type keys
were UPPERCASE (`CLABSI`/`VAP`/`CAUTI`) while the enricher writes
lowercase, silently no-op'ing the entire lift in production. The
+2,135 WBC / +50.4 CRP CAUTI delta in the DQR was a UTI disease
confounder, not the lift code. Fixes applied (commit `4dd36a55`):
single-source-of-truth `HAI_TYPES = ("clabsi","cauti","vap")` +
import-time YAML validation; `run_forced` calls
`register_builtin_enrichers()`; closed-form `_hai_lift_delta` replaces
double-`derive_lab_values`; multi-event = max; `state_history[N+1]`
off-by-one fix; `obs.flag` recomputed via `determine_flag`; draw hour
from order.ordered_datetime; snapshot_dt truncation extended to HAI
events + cultures; `hai_flags_from_record` deleted as dead code;
29-line dead block removed from `_simulate_unknown_condition`.
Verification: lift-firing proof (closed-form delta matches actual
`apply_hai_lab_lift` output exactly), DQR 3-axis still PASS, byte-diff
37/37 IDENTICAL preserved. See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-25-phase3a-hai-lab-lift-data-quality-review-post-fix.md`.

**Phase 3b-1 HAI empirical antibiotic regimen — 2026-06-25 (✓ done)**:
First of the 4-PR Phase 3b series. `modules/antibiotic/` always-on
Module (AD-55 *near-essential clinical cascade* category — new AD-55
supplement in DESIGN.md). Consumes `extensions["hai"]`, emits IDSA
2009/2016 guideline empirical regimens (CLABSI = Vanc q12h + Pip-Tazo
q6h × 14d / CAUTI = Ceftriaxone q24h × 7d / VAP = Vanc q12h + Pip-Tazo
q6h × 7d). Dual-write storage: `record.orders` (MedicationRequest) +
`record.medication_administrations` (MAR) + `extensions["antibiotic"]`
(cross-PR consumption). Zero new FHIR builders (reuses
`_fhir_medications.py`). AD-32 future-onset HAI defensive skip in
enricher prevents orphan Order/MAR. `modules/antibiotic/audit.py` =
second AD-60 plug-in with closed-form lift_firing_proof (Ceftriaxone
q24h × 7d delta). `ForcedScenario.force_hai_event` added (Task 7b) for
deterministic HAI testing. Vancomycin RxNorm 11124 + YJ 6113400
centralized (existing repo usage). 12 commits across 12 tasks.

**Phase 3b-2 HAI culture S/I/R — 2026-06-26 (✓ done)**:
PR #96 + adversarial fan-out fix PRs #97 + #98.
`_append_hai_culture` extended with antibiogram-driven susceptibility sampling.
`hai_antibiogram.yaml` (CDC NHSN AR 2018-2020) as source of truth; import-time
3-way cross-validation (HAI_TYPES + hai_organisms + ANTIBIOTIC_LOINC_LOOKUP) +
`_NHSN_RESISTANCE_BANDS` import-time validation (PR #98 MED-4).
`MicrobiologyResult.hai_event_id` backref + `AntibioticRegimen.discontinuation_datetime`
forward-compat reserves shipped. `ANTIBIOTIC_DRUGS` tuple → dict refactor +
`ANTIBIOTIC_LOINC_LOOKUP` companion. LOINC orphan fix (ciprofloxacin → cefepime).
`run_forced` force_hai_event injection gap closed (PR #96 Task 6 + PR #97 F-CRIT-2
load-bearing test). Audit: `antibiogram_firing_proof` (PR-94 equality_checks format)
+ non-degenerate cefazolin sentinel (PR #98 LOW-1) + sub-proof exception isolation
(PR #98 MED-3). AD-16 hardening: `_CapturingRNG` logs `p=` array; YAML key-order pin
tests for clabsi/cauti/vap pinned organisms; YAML header LOAD-BEARING comment
(PR #98 MED-1+MED-2). DQR:
`docs/reviews/2026-06-26-phase-3b-2-hai-susceptibility-data-quality-review.md`

**Post-merge adversarial fan-out (8 agents)** found 30+ findings the per-task
+ final whole-branch reviews missed, including 2 CRITICAL (mypy strict 11 errors
in `clinosim/audit/registry.py:23` `clinical_acceptance` type; Task 6 run_forced
injection had zero load-bearing test — reverting passed all tests = PR-90 class
silent-no-op recurrence) + 1 MAJOR (HAI_EMPTY_SUSCEPTIBILITIES_MAX_RATE denominator
undefined → PR3b-3 gate would always-FAIL). Fix PR #97 closed all 7 load-bearing
findings; Fix PR #98 closed 25+ MEDIUM/LOW/MINOR. Validates `feedback_iterative_adversarial_review`
memory: test green + final review APPROVE is not ship-ready; fix PRs themselves
need adversarial review (3-stage chain pattern from PR-93/#94/#95 re-confirmed).

Phase 3b backlog (remaining):
- ~~PR3b-3~~: ✓ done 2026-06-27 — narrow / de-escalation chain. Same `enrich_antibiotic`
  Pass 2 reads `MicrobiologyResult.hai_event_id` backref → ladder walk → 3 outcomes
  (SWITCH / ELIMINATION / NO_CHANGE). New `narrow_ladder.yaml` (3-way validated).
  `OrderStatus.STOPPED` + FHIR `MedicationRequest.status="stopped"` wiring.
  Audit clinical axis active enforcement: NHSN R-rate + empty rate + new narrow rate.
  `lift_firing_proof` extended to 17 equality_checks (8+3+6).
- ~~PR3b-3 D1+D2~~: ✓ done 2026-06-29 (PR #112 + adv-1 #113 + adv-2 #114
  + adv-3 #115 = 4-stage adversarial chain converged) — clinical axis
  per-(hai_type, organism, antibiotic) R-rate filter via `_organism_per_encounter`
  + panel-eligible empty-rate denominator via `_panel_eligible_organisms`.
  Both TODO markers removed (clinical.py + antibiotic/audit.py). 6-layer
  silent-no-op defense complete. PR3b-3 original-spec deferred TODOs = 0.
- ~~PR3b-5~~: ✓ done 2026-06-29 — specimen-based susc → organism join +
  FHIR HAI_EVENT_ID_SYSTEM identifier emission resolved the PR3b-3 D1
  encounter-level attribution approximation. C1 (multi-organism encounter
  double-count) and C2 (community + HAI culture co-occurrence) both
  mechanically excluded. New helpers `_organism_per_specimen` +
  `_hai_specimens` in `clinosim/audit/axes/clinical.py`. FHIR identifier
  emission added to Specimen + mb-org-* / mb-sus-* Observation +
  DiagnosticReport (`clinosim/modules/output/_fhir_microbiology.py`). See
  `docs/reviews/2026-06-29-pr3b-5-attribution-refinement-dqr.md`.

Out-of-scope items deferred from PR3b-5 (formal tracking — each one
required so the chain closure can honestly claim "no half-finished state
remains"):

- PR3b-4: WBC/CRP forward-delta decay coupled with antibiotic-day count.
  Sibling to the Phase 3a HAI lift pattern; antibiotic start_day initiates
  a forward decay on WBC + CRP observed values mirroring the lift profile.
  Independent of PR3b-3 / PR3b-5 — purely new realism work.
- Sibling YAML loader sweep (hai_lab_lift / hai_rates / hai_codes /
  hai_specimens / hai_organisms additional reverse-coverage): apply the
  silent-no-op defense pattern established by PR3b-3 chain to all
  remaining hai_*.yaml loaders. Scope-tiny pattern application. **This is
  the next user-declared breakpoint after PR3b-5** (区切り = PR3b-5 +
  sibling sweep 両 chain CLOSED).
- audit registry `_reset_for_test` ordering bug: 10 fail master baseline
  (production code healthy, test isolation issue only). Tests that call
  `discover()` end up with empty registry after another test's
  `_reset_for_test`. Fix candidate: autouse fixture in conftest that
  re-discovers before each integration test.
- audit clinical axis Phase 2 (per-event observed-vs-theoretical
  enforcement): new axis-level enforcement walking CIF state_history per
  event for closed-form delta verification. Currently the silent_no_op
  axis lift_firing_proof covers this at synthetic-fixture level; Phase 2
  would enforce per-real-event at audit run time.
- NHSN clinical-accuracy band verification (CoNS / K.pneumoniae VAP /
  A.baumannii VAP exempt entries): adv-2 Agent 1 (PR #114 review) flagged
  that NHSN AR 2018-2020 may publish stable population bands for organisms
  currently in `_NHSN_REVERSE_COVERAGE_EXEMPT`. Verify against the NHSN
  tables and either ADD a band (preferred) or tighten the exempt rationale.
- I1 WARN per-country diagnostic improvement: current WARN message fires
  per country with identical wording; symptom (antibiogram corruption /
  mb-org drift / SNOMED URI drift) is global. Improve by probing
  individual root cause and emitting one global WARN with specific
  dispatch.
- Unused MB_*_PREFIX cleanup (MB_SUS / MB_SPECIMEN / MB_DR): extracted
  in PR #113 for consistency but currently no reader imports them.
  YAGNI cleanup once a reader appears (or remove if no reader added by
  the next refactor).
- DESIGN.md AD-55 / AD-60 PR3b-3 supplement extended ADR text: brief
  closure note already in AD-60. A longer ADR-quality narrative covering
  the 7-layer silent-no-op defense pattern (including
  `HAI_EVENT_ID_SYSTEM` from PR3b-5) and the AD-55 near-essential clinical
  cascade extension is a documentation polish item.

Phase 3c backlog:
- HAI → outcome_benchmarks mortality coupling
- Lactate / Plt / 体温 / SBP sepsis cascade using same forward-delta pattern
- LOS extension from HAI

DQR audit-script strengthening (post PR-90 review learning) ✓ done
2026-06-25: clinosim audit framework Phase 1 (AD-60). New CLI subcommand
`clinosim audit run` absorbs the previous 3-axis DQR scripts and adds a
silent_no_op axis (canonical-constants cross-check + lift-firing proof) —
the load-bearing verification PR-90 was missing. Per-Module checks
co-locate in `clinosim/modules/<name>/audit.py`. First plug-in:
`modules/hai/audit.py`. byte-diff vs master @ p=2000: 37/37 NDJSON
byte-IDENTICAL — audit framework is pure read-only consumer. See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-25-clinosim-audit-baseline.md`.

Per-Module audit.py backlog for Phase 3b/c:
- modules/antibiotic/audit.py ✓ done 2026-06-25 (PR3b-1, empirical regimen + lift_firing_proof)
- modules/antibiotic/audit.py ✓ extended 2026-06-26 (PR3b-2: _ABX_LOINCS + _NHSN_RESISTANCE_BANDS + HAI_EMPTY_SUSCEPTIBILITIES_MAX_RATE + antibiogram_firing_proof)
- modules/antibiotic/audit.py ✓ extended 2026-06-27 (PR3b-3: _NARROW_RATE_BANDS + _pr3b3_narrow_proof_checks (6 checks) + load_narrow_ladder import-time touch; clinical axis active enforcement of all 3 gates in clinosim/audit/axes/clinical.py)
- modules/decay/audit.py (Phase 3b-4: WBC/CRP antibiotic-day decay)
- modules/mortality/audit.py (Phase 3c: HAI → outcome coupling)
- modules/sepsis_cascade/audit.py (Phase 3c: Lactate/Plt/Temp/SBP)
Each Module's own PR adds its audit.py alongside the feature.

Backlog: **PR_C type consolidation** — 7 modules currently define types
in `engine.py` instead of `clinosim/types/` (CLAUDE.md "All types
defined in clinosim/types/" rule). Code refactor with byte-diff risk;
separate concern from docs work. Modules: population (PersonRecord/
LifeEvent/HospitalizationSummary), facility (HospitalState), procedure
(ProcedureMeta/ProcedureRecord/RehabSession), encounter (no Pydantic
protocol type), staff (StaffMember/StaffRoster), validator (4 dataclass
reports). DiseaseProtocol is already in protocol.py — different concern.

**Master HEAD Comprehensive 3-axis DQR — 2026-06-24:** First post-PR_docs
goal verification using the new "PR 検証ガイド" framework. **All 3 axes
PASS for both US and JP** at the project's true goal: FHIR R4 / JP Core
compliance + 臨床整合性 + JP localization 品質.

- US p=10,000 + JP p=5,000, seed=42, format=CIF + fhir-r4
- Structural: 0 errors, 0 warnings (3.4M US + 434K JP Observations,
  id uniqueness 100%, reference integrity 100%, refRange/interp 87.2%
  with the 12.8% being legitimate O2 admin + 24h I/O)
- Clinical: US warfarin INR shift +1.00, HbA1c×Glucose r=0.636; JP
  JLAC10 全 17 主要 lab (Cr/Glucose/WBC/AST/ALT/Hb/K/Na/CRP/PT_INR/
  HCO3/Plt/pH/pCO2/pO2/D-dimer/Troponin) 全て臨床的妥当帯
- JP Language: US 全 10 NDJSON で日本語混入 0; JP 100% 日本語化
  (Cond/DR/Med/Imm/care_level/smoking/alcohol); JLAC10 with JCCLS-JSLM
  公式日本語表示 (クレアチニン / プロトロンビン時間 等); CM-granular
  ICD 漏洩 0

**Audit findings clarified (not defects)**:
- DOAC INR delta = 0.60 (US) / 1.10 (JP) was an audit-script false-
  negative caused by `_derive_home_medications` independent-draw
  artifact (Phase 2c backlog). JP has 0 DOAC-only patients; the
  warfarin-only cohort (n=4) shows correct therapeutic INR p50=2.70.
- JP DR text=0% was an audit-script bug (checked `code.text` instead
  of `code.coding[].display`); actual display is 100% Japanese
  ("肝機能パネル" 等).
- JP non-INR labs n=0 was audit-script's US-LOINC-only filter
  limitation; manual JLAC10 query confirmed all bands valid.

Report: `docs/reviews/2026-06-24-master-comprehensive-dqr.md` —
includes per-axis evidence tables and the top-15 JLAC10 codes with
counts + JCCLS Japanese display verification.

**Audit script enhancements queued (next DQR cycle)**:
- Add JLAC10 code support (currently only LOINC; JP non-INR labs
  silently return n=0 without JLAC10 hardcoded)
- Fix JP DR display check (read `code.coding[].display` not `code.text`)
- DOAC cohort separation: filter out warfarin co-prescription so
  "DOAC-only" INR baseline can be measured cleanly

These are non-blocking; the manual JLAC10 confirmation in this DQR
already validated JP clinical bands.

**Coag panel activation (LOINC 24373-3) + APTT/PT/Fibrinogen derives
(2026-06-24):** Activates the previously-defined-but-dormant Coag
DiagnosticReport panel (LOINC 24373-3) by extending
`physiology.derive_lab_values` with three new analytes — all from
existing state axes (no new `PhysiologicalState` field), AD-57
BNP-pattern surgical:

- `APTT = clamp(30 + coagulation_status*55, 20, 150)` (seconds; healthy
  ~30, DIC ~85)
- `PT = clamp(12 * PT_INR, 9, 90)` (seconds; ISI=1.0 consistency
  invariant tying PT to the existing PT_INR)
- `Fibrinogen = clamp(300 + infl*250 - coag*280, 50, 800)` (mg/dL;
  **biphasic** — acute-phase reactant ↑ in inflammation, consumed ↓ in
  DIC. Healthy ~300, sepsis-no-DIC ~512, sepsis+DIC ~289, severe DIC
  floor 50.)

Also adopts improvements (uniform rule
`feedback_propose_improvements_to_existing`):
- I1: `lab_panels.yaml` gains Coag/LFT/Lipid/UA (symmetry with
  `lab_panel_groups.yaml` restored)
- I2: `lab_panel_groups.yaml` Coag block documents LOINC 24373-3
  authoritative scope (Fibrinogen/D-dimer panel-external)
- I3: stale "Cl/Ca in BMP today" comment refreshed
- I8: Fibrinogen "range exists, derive missing" gap closed

Authoritative code data (NLM + JSLM v137 verified): LOINC 14979-9 APTT,
5902-2 PT (existing entry reused), 3255-7 Fibrinogen (existing; `en`
shortened to "Fibrinogen" per clean-display convention). JLAC10 2B020
APTT, 2B100 Fibrinogen, 2B030 (existing — shared by PT seconds and
PT-INR since the 5-char analyte code does not distinguish result
representation).

Byte-diff vs master `fbd80607` @ p=2000 seed=42 (both US and JP):
nine NDJSONs (Patient/Encounter/Condition/Medication*/Procedure/
Imaging/Immunization/FamilyHistory) byte-identical; only
Observation.ndjson + DiagnosticReport.ndjson change (new APTT/PT/
Fibrinogen Observations + new Coag DRs). 3-axis DQR (US p=10000 +
JP p=5000) all PASS — structural / clinical (sepsis admit
Fibrinogen p50 501-516 in 350-650 acute-phase band, APTT p75 31.1-31.9
above upper reference) / JP language (zero US leak, 2760 JP
instances, jlac10 `ja` JCCLS-official). See
`docs/reviews/2026-06-24-coag-panel-data-quality-review.md`,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-23-coag-panel-physiology-design.md`,
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-coag-panel-physiology.md`.

Deferred to follow-up PRs (recorded as backlog):
- **Phase 2**: `D_dimer` derive + `causes_vte` scenario flag for
  PE/DVT/cerebral_infarction/hemorrhagic_stroke
- **`on_anticoagulation` axis**: warfarin/heparin therapeutic-range INR
  modelling (pair with D-dimer Phase 2 PR)
- **I4 panel-YAML unification**: merge `lab_panels.yaml` and
  `lab_panel_groups.yaml` to a single canonical analyte source
- **I6 `clinical_course.actions[].test` field disambiguation**: separate
  orderable test names from natural-language action descriptors
- **I7 `platelet_status` axis**: decouple Plt from `coagulation_status`
  so ITP/chemotherapy/MDS can be modelled separately
- **LOS-mid DIC subset audit**: confirm Fibrinogen DIC-consumption tail
  emerges in the sepsis subset that accumulates `coagulation_status`
  over LOS

**BMP Cl/Ca physiology + anion_gap_status axis + Pass 1 sub-RNG
isolation (PR Cl/Ca, 2026-06-23):** Completes BMP canonical 8
emission. `derive_lab_values` gains Cl (AG-aware: high-AG keeps Cl
near normal, non-AG diarrhea gives hyperchloremic Cl) and total Ca
(multi-axis: sepsis / CKD / hepatic dysfunction drop it, mild
dehydration lifts). A new `anion_gap_status` axis on
`PhysiologicalState` (orthogonal to AD-57 acid-base 2-axis, does NOT
affect pH/HCO3/pCO2) is set on 20 AG-disturbing disease YAMLs +
2 encounters (viral GE / food poisoning) per textbook AG behaviour.
BMP `min_components` raised 5 → 7 (canonical N − 1 = 8 − 1) with the
5th-percentile floor of panel-order-placed days landing at 7.
**Structural defect discovered + fixed in the same PR:** `inpatient.py`
Pass 1 / `emergency.py` / `outpatient.py` lab loops were drawing
specimen-rejection / hemolysis / technician / noise from the master
RNG. PR #74 had isolated panel children only; individual (non-panel-child)
lab orders remained on the master stream, so any YAML edit toggling a
`{test:"X"}` order between "engine doesn't produce X" → "engine
produces X" silently shuffled unrelated cohorts. Fixed via a new
`simulator/seeding.py:individual_lab_seed(order_id)` mirroring
`panel_specimen_seed`; the three lab loops now build a per-order rng
from it. Integration tests guard the property
(`tests/integration/test_individual_lab_isolation.py`). Data-quality
review (US p=10000 + JP p=5000, seed=42): structural 100 % clean, JP
localization 100 %, 7/8 clinical PASS, HF BNP `[FAIL]` is the same
admit-day-mixing artifact documented in PR #71 (no BNP change in this
PR). See `docs/reviews/2026-06-23-bmp-cl-ca-data-quality-review.md`,

## Architecture Decisions (current)

| Decision | Date | Description |
|---|---|---|
| AD-1 | 2026-04-04 | Two simulation modes: Mode 1 (Patient Record) and Mode 2 (Hospital Operations). Mode 2 is a superset. Design for Mode 2, implement Mode 1 first. |
| AD-2 | 2026-04-04 | Modular folder structure: each module is a self-contained folder with README.md. |
| AD-3 | 2026-04-04 | Population-driven forward simulation: generate catchment population first, simulate life events, hospital visits are consequences of population dynamics. |
| AD-4 | 2026-04-04 | Two-layer population model: Layer 1 (lightweight registry for all persons) and Layer 2 (detailed clinical profile, activated only on hospital visit). |
| AD-5 | 2026-04-04 | Household-based generation: people belong to households, enabling realistic family history, infection transmission, and shared attributes. |
| AD-6 | 2026-04-04 | Referring clinics as context (not simulation targets): generate referral letters and prior records without full GP simulation. |
| AD-7 | 2026-04-04 | LLM as selective amplifier: enhances narratives and clinical reasoning; all numerical/structural data remains rule-based. |
| AD-8 | 2026-04-04 | Three generation modes: `none` (structured only), `template` (rule-based text), `llm` (full LLM enhancement). System fully functional without LLM. |
| AD-9 | 2026-04-04 | Compact context pattern: pre-summarized `LLMClinicalContext` (~300 tokens) instead of full patient record for each LLM call. |
| AD-10 | 2026-04-04 | Batch + cache strategy: LLM called at key narrative points only (4–11 calls per patient), with pattern caching for common scenarios. |
| AD-11 | 2026-04-04 | All LLM calls go through `llm_service` module. No other module may call LLM directly. |
| AD-12 | 2026-04-04 | Default LLM provider: local Ollama (qwen:7b). Cloud APIs (Anthropic) available as optional fallback. Provider abstraction enables addition of other LLM providers. |
| AD-13 | 2026-04-04 | Two LLM task categories: JUDGMENT (always English) and NARRATIVE (target country language). English judgment = better quality + fewer tokens. |
| AD-14 | 2026-04-04 | Three-tier validation: Tier 1 statistical benchmarks (automated), Tier 2 clinical pattern validation (automated+expert), Tier 3 domain expert blind test (human). |
| AD-15 | 2026-04-04 | Output as pluggable adapter system: each format (FHIR R4, CSV, HL7v2, etc.) is a separate adapter implementing OutputAdapter interface. |
| AD-16 | 2026-04-04 | Reproducibility via hierarchical seed management. Each module gets deterministic sub-seed. LLM outputs cached to disk for reproducible runs. |
| AD-17 | 2026-04-04 | Three-stage output: (1) Sim + JUDGMENT LLM → CIF structural (immutable) → (2) CIF + NARRATIVE LLM → narrative layer (replaceable) → (3) structural + narrative → format adapters. |
| AD-18 | 2026-04-04 | Pydantic for YAML configs (schema validation at load). @dataclass for runtime types. |
| AD-19 | 2026-04-04 | Preset + override config: `SimulatorConfig.preset("japan_medium").override({...})` |
| AD-20 | 2026-04-04 | LLM graceful degradation: retry → template fallback → structured-only. Never halt. |
| AD-21 | 2026-04-04 | Vertical slice: v0.1-alpha (1 patient) → v0.1-beta (population) → v0.1 (full). |
| AD-22 | 2026-04-04 | Three-level testing: unit (<30s) → integration (<5min) → e2e golden file (<30min). |
| AD-23 | 2026-04-04 | Async LLM at patient level. Bounded concurrency. Sync fallback available. |
| AD-24 | 2026-04-04 | JUDGMENT and NARRATIVE use independently configurable LLM providers/models. Local + cloud mix supported. |
| AD-25 | 2026-04-04 | CIF is language-neutral. Person names are country-specific at generation time. All other localization at output/Stage 2. |
| AD-26 | 2026-04-04 | Clinical terminology uses official master data only (JLAC10, LOINC, etc.). Never LLM-translated. |
| AD-27 | 2026-04-04 | All locale data (names, terminology, code mapping, formatting) centralized in `clinosim/locale/`. Adding a country = adding YAML files. |
| **AD-28** | 2026-04-06 | **Diagnosis vs ground truth separation**: `ConditionEvent` (hidden truth) vs `ClinicalDiagnosis` (what hospital concludes). Misdiagnosis is first-class. |
| **AD-29** | 2026-04-06 | **Diagnostic accuracy via likelihood ratios**: Bayesian update with per-disease LR_TABLE. Configurable correctness rates. |
| **AD-30** | 2026-04-08 | **Code is the truth**: CIF stores only codes + system keys. Display text is resolved at output time via `clinosim.codes`. No `*_name` fields in CIF types. |
| **AD-31** | 2026-04-08 | **FHIR Bulk Data Export NDJSON**: replaced per-encounter Bundle JSON with HL7 FHIR Bulk Data Access compliant NDJSON (one file per resource type + manifest.json). Globally unique Resource.id within each type. |
| **AD-32** | 2026-04-08 | **Snapshot date semantics**: `--end` is the snapshot date. Inpatients still admitted at snapshot become `Encounter.status="in-progress"` with no `discharge_datetime`. Enables current-state EHR queries. |
| **AD-33** | 2026-04-08 | **English-first code systems**: every entry in `clinosim/codes/data/*.yaml` MUST have an `en` field. Other languages are translation attributes with English fallback. |
| **AD-34** | 2026-04-08 | **Hospital config-driven physical layout**: `available_departments` + `department_rollup` + `wards` + `ward_capacity` in hospital YAML drives staff generation, ward assignment, bed location resources. |
| **AD-35** | 2026-04-08 | **codes module separated from locale**: international code systems (ICD/LOINC/RxNorm/etc.) live in `clinosim/codes/`, NOT under `locale/`. Codes are international standards; translations are attributes. |
| **AD-36** | 2026-04-09 | **FHIR Procedure structural fields via SNOMED CT**: category (surgical/diagnostic/therapeutic), performer.function (surgeon/anaesthetist), recorder, reasonReference, bodySite, location (OR), outcome, complication. Metadata table `_PROCEDURE_METADATA` in procedure engine. |
| **AD-37** | 2026-04-09 | **Three explicit CLI stages**: `generate` (structural CIF) → `narrate` (clinical documents) → `export-fhir` (FHIR R4 NDJSON). Each stage is independently runnable; Stage 2 can be executed remotely (e.g. EC2 for Bedrock) while Stage 1/3 stay local. |
| **AD-38** | 2026-04-09 | **Clinical documents as FHIR DocumentReference (Tier A+B)**: Discharge Summary (LOINC 18842-5), Death Note (69730-0), Operative Note (11504-8), Admission H&P (34117-2), Procedure Note (28570-0). 5 document types, ~374 documents per 5000-population run. Base64 text/plain attachment with sha1 hash and size. |
| **AD-39** | 2026-04-09 | **LLM provider plugin registry**: `providers/` subpackage with `LLMProvider` Protocol. Registry maps config keys (`ollama`, `bedrock`, `mock`, `local`) to builder callables. `factory.build_from_config_file()` wires providers + cache + registry from YAML. Bedrock uses boto3 lazy import. |
| **AD-40** | 2026-04-09 | **Prompt templates as per-language YAML**: `clinosim/modules/llm_service/prompts/<lang>/<task>.yaml` with `system`, `user_template`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `version`. Rendered via `string.Template` (stdlib, zero deps). Language fallback to English (mirrors codes module). |
| **AD-41** | 2026-04-09 | **SHA256 disk cache for LLM responses**: `PromptCache` keys by `SHA256(system ‖ user ‖ model)`. Enables reproducible re-runs, partial re-run recovery, and cost control for Bedrock. Cache stats in `cost_report()`. |
| **AD-42** | 2026-04-13 | **Code-side unit conversion for Japanese locale**: CRP mg/L→mg/dL conversion happens in `hospital_course_extractor` and `document_generator` (not in LLM prompt). `format_lab_trends(language=)` and `_initial_labs(language=)` apply locale-specific conversion factors. |
| **AD-43** | 2026-04-13 | **Japanese narrative prompt quality rules**: All ja prompts include mandatory 「医師」suffix for staff names. Markdown forbidden — use 【】 section headers, ■ subheaders, ・ bullets. |
| **AD-44** | 2026-04-15 | **Enrichment is language-neutral, display at output time**: A/B test confirmed LLM translates drug/procedure names reliably. Enrichment passes English text to LLM; only 2 code-side exceptions: (1) `code_lookup(system, code, lang)` for official short-form diagnosis names, (2) CRP unit conversion (math). |
| **AD-45** | 2026-04-15 | **Occupation field on Patient/PersonRecord**: 12 categories (manufacturing, construction, agriculture, healthcare, service, office, transportation, education, homemaker, student, retired, unemployed). Drives work-related injury incidence via `occupation_risk_multipliers` in demographics.yaml. FHIR Observation (LOINC 11341-5, social-history). |
| **AD-46** | 2026-04-16 | **Multilingual FHIR coding**: Condition and Procedure emit dual coding entries (primary language + interop language). `_build_diagnosis_codeable_concept()` resolves from both `icd-10` and `icd-10-cm` with cross-system fallback. Never emits `display==code`. |
| **AD-47** | 2026-04-16 | **FHIR Observation referenceRange/interpretation consistency**: Both must be present and consistent per FHIR R5 Note 5. Lab interpretation recomputed from value vs referenceRange (not CIF flag alone). Vital signs include normal + critical (panic) reference ranges as separate entries. |
| **AD-48** | 2026-04-16 | **Procedure display via code dictionary (AD-30 strict)**: `procedure_name` removed from ProcedureRecord — display resolved at output time via `code_lookup("k-codes"|"cpt", code, lang)`. Both `procedure_code_jp` and `procedure_code_us` stored in CIF for multilingual FHIR output. |
| **AD-49** | 2026-04-18 | **Condition code.text with clinical abbreviations**: `_CONDITION_SHORT_NAME` maps ICD base codes to search-friendly short names (COPD, CHF, CKD, DM, AF, etc.) in both EN and JA. `coding[].display` keeps official ICD name. |
| **AD-50** | 2026-04-18 | **Medication protocol prefix stripping**: `_strip_protocol_prefix()` separates category prefixes (DVT_prophylaxis:, antipyretic:, etc.) from drug name in `medicationCodeableConcept.text`. Drug name only in text, protocol context in dosageInstruction. |
| **AD-51** | 2026-06-23 | **Panel-children RNG isolation (one specimen, one RNG)**: every lab `Order` produced by panel expansion (`_run_daily_loop`'s Pass 2) draws specimen-rejection / hemolysis / staff-assignment / result-timing from a per-parent sub-RNG seeded by `panel_specimen_seed(parent_order_id)` (in `clinosim/simulator/seeding.py`), not from the patient-scoped master RNG. Two consequences: (a) editing `lab_panels.yaml` (e.g. registering CBC or BMP) cannot cascade into unrelated patients' cohorts — the master stream stays exactly the same length regardless of which panels are registered (AD-16 compliance). (b) Specimen rejection becomes per-specimen (one parent → all-or-nothing on children) rather than per-analyte, which is clinically correct because a panel order is one tube. PR #74. Tested by `tests/integration/test_panel_expansion_cbc_bmp.py::test_panel_children_cancellation_is_per_specimen` and `tests/unit/test_seeding.py::TestPanelSpecimenSeed::test_formula_is_pinned`. |

### Phase 0 — Extensibility foundation (AD-56, do before the enrichment roadmap)

> Enabling refactors so each AD-55 item is "register a builder/enricher" instead of editing
> central monoliths. Gate with existing golden/e2e + determinism (AD-16).

- [ ] **① FHIR resource-builder registry** — replace the hand-appended `_build_bundle()`
  (`output/fhir_r4_adapter.py`) with a registry of `(record, ctx) -> list[resource]` builders;
  each declares dedup behaviour (patient-level vs per-encounter). Core loops & emits. **Highest leverage.**
- [ ] **② Simulator enricher registry** — replace inlined passes in `run_beta()`
  (`simulator/engine.py`) with enrichers registered as `name`/`order`/`enabled(config)`/`run(...)`;
  iterate in fixed order (determinism). Migrate `assign_identities` to it as the first consumer.
- [ ] **④ CIF extensions slot** — add `CIFPatientRecord.extensions: dict[str, Any]`
  (`types/output.py`). Base = typed fields; Modules write `extensions[<module>]`, never edit core type.
- [ ] **③ Config module-enablement map** — `SimulatorConfig.modules: dict[str, bool]` +
  `module_enabled()` helper (`types/config.py`); keep `jp_insurance_numbers` as back-compat alias.
- [ ] **⑤ (with microbiology)** externalize `observation` lab catalog (CV/precision/units) to YAML.
- Deferred: ⑥ CSV adapter registry (low leverage — new table ≈ 3 lines).

### AD-57 — Unify observation (lab + vital) generation across venues

> Today lab/vital values come from **3 divergent paths**: inpatient = physiology
> `derive_lab_values(state)` (state/comorbidity-aware); ED (`emergency.py`) + outpatient
> (`outpatient.py`) = hardcoded `baseline_values` dicts + a dangerous `default 100`
> fallback, ignoring patient comorbidities. This caused the troponin canonicalization to
> be applied in 3 places and risks venue inconsistency (e.g. a CKD patient's ED creatinine
> reads normal). Unify into one generation service.

- [x] **Phase 1 — ED/outpatient labs → physiology.** `emergency.py` + `outpatient.py` now
  build a baseline `PhysiologicalState` from the patient's chronic conditions
  (`initialize_state`) and derive true values with `derive_lab_values` (comorbidity-aware:
  CKD → high Cr/low eGFR, verified). Dangerous `default 100` replaced with a normal fallback.
  `baseline_values` retained only for analytes physiology doesn't model. Same RNG draw
  count → determinism preserved; integration/e2e green.
- [ ] Extract a single `generate_observations(...)` wrapper so the 3 venues share one
  call (currently they share the physiology functions but duplicate the boilerplate).
- [x] **Encounter scenarios carry acute physiology.** ED encounter YAMLs gained an optional
  `initial_state_impact` (per severity, same schema as disease protocols) + `acid_base_type`;
  `emergency.py` applies it via `apply_disease_onset` after `initialize_state`, so BOTH labs
  and vitals reflect the acute illness, not just comorbidity baseline. Populated for the
  conditions with a clear physiological signature: infections (UTI/viral URI → WBC/CRP/temp),
  dehydration (gastroenteritis/food poisoning → volume↓ → BUN↑, BP↓/HR↑), hyperventilation
  (asthma/panic → respiratory alkalosis), local→systemic (animal bite/minor burn).
  Trivial presentations (screening, suture removal) carry no impact (no-op). Audit (pop 30k):
  UTI WBC median 10,177 (vs ~7,500 baseline), gastroenteritis dehydration, panic pCO2 < 38.
  Data-driven (user principle: lab changes from scenario/profile). 4 unit tests.
- [x] **ABG panel expansion + pO2 done.** `observation/reference_data/lab_panels.yaml`
  (data-driven) maps `ABG` → pH/pCO2/pO2/HCO3; panel orders are expanded into component
  lab orders (parent marked resulted) so each resolves via the scalar path. physiology
  derives pO2 (inflammation-proxied hypoxemia). LOINC/JLAC10 codes added. Respiratory
  cohort now gets blood-gas results (was none) — verified COPD pH/pCO2/pO2/HCO3 resolve.
- [x] **Unify vitals generation.** ED (`emergency.py`) + outpatient (`outpatient.py`) now
  derive vitals from the comorbidity-adjusted `PhysiologicalState` via the same path as
  inpatient. New shared helper `physiology.derive_observed_vitals(state, baseline, ts, rng)`
  = `derive_vital_signs` + measurement noise; inpatient `_make_raw` delegates to it (output
  unchanged — identical RNG draws). ED temp/SpO2/HR now track physiology (e.g. febrile up to
  39.1 °C, hypoxia to 87 %, shock SBP to 66) instead of a fixed normal template; outpatient
  keeps its measured-subset (`fields`) logic. Determinism preserved (same draw count/order);
  unit/integration/e2e green. **Acute-presentation injection** (folding ED scenario severity
  into the state so labs+vitals reflect the acute illness, not just comorbidity baseline)
  deferred — see the `initial_state_impact` item above.
- [x] FHIR code-mapping cleanup (from CIF/FHIR eval): US LOINC for lipids/TSH/ESR
  (+ loinc displays), outpatient lipid/ESR baselines (was 1.0 garbage), ECG/non-analyte
  guard in ED/outpatient (was fabricated empty-code lab). US empty-code labs 328→0.
- [x] **JP JLAC10 codes verified & corrected.** Added Troponin_I (5C094), CK_MB (3B015),
  LDL (3F077), HDL (3F070), TG (3F015), TC (3F050), TSH (4A055), ESR (2Z010) — all verified
  against the official **JSLM JLAC10 master v137 (2026-06)** (`jslm.org/committees/code/`),
  lipids cross-checked vs jpfhir.jp JP-CLINS/eCheckup. **Audit also exposed ~13 pre-existing
  fabricated/mismapped codes** in `jlac10.yaml` (Hb/Hct/BUN/Na/K/Cl/Ca/T_Bil/LDH/PCT/BNP/
  Lactate were off, blood gas pH/pCO2/pO2/HCO3 pointed at the 6A0xx **microbiology** range) —
  all corrected to the master codes. Source cited in both files; integrity guard test added
  (`test_codes_jlac10.py`, 28 cases). JP FHIR audit: 31 correct JLAC10 codes + 和名 emitted.
- [x] **US LOINC verified.** All 38 US-mapped LOINC codes confirmed vs NLM Clinical Tables
  LOINC API (no fabrication). Fixed 4 duplicate YAML keys + normalized verbose display
  (PR #10). Cross-system dup-key guard added (`test_codes_integrity.py`).
- [x] **Authoritative-source comments** added to every code-data file (icd-10-cm, icd-10,
  rxnorm, cpt, k-codes, yj + earlier jlac10/loinc/snomed) and locale code_mapping files.
- [x] **ICD diagnosis-code review (2026-06 finding) — FIXED.** `code_mapping_diagnosis.yaml`
  was dead config (`load_code_mapping` never called for "diagnosis") so US emitted
  non-billable 3-char category codes (I50, I21, ...) and WHO-only codes (F00). Now wired into
  the FHIR adapter (`_build_conditions`, both primary + chronic dx via `_map_diagnosis_code`).
  US translates every internal chronic/history base code + non-billable primary to a billable
  ICD-10-CM leaf (chronic→unspecified leaf; past-acute-as-chronic→"history of/old" e.g.
  I21→I25.2; primary specificity/7th-char e.g. R05→R05.9, S72.00→S72.009A, T07→T07.XXXA).
  All targets verified vs NLM ICD-10-CM API (no fabrication) + added to `icd-10-cm.yaml`.
  Audit (US 10k): 91/91 distinct Condition codes billable, 0 non-billable.
- [x] **Used-but-missing diagnosis codes — FIXED (PR #19).** Disease/encounter scenarios
  referenced 19 ICD codes absent from code-data (display fell back to approximate prefix
  match). Registered after NLM/WHO verification; fixed miscode K57.11 (small-intestine) →
  K57.31 (large-intestine diverticular bleeding). Coverage invariant added
  (`test_diagnosis_code_coverage.py`).
- [x] **JP diagnosis output → true WHO ICD-10 granularity — FIXED (PR #20).** JP previously
  emitted ICD-10-CM-granularity codes (7th-char `S06.0X0A`, 5-char `A41.01`, `Z00.00`) under
  the WHO `icd-10` system URI, resolving only via cm-fallback. `code_mapping_diagnosis/jp.yaml`
  now folds every internal code to WHO 3-4 char (+110 WHO codes verified vs icd.who.int/
  browse10/2019; R65 axis differs in WHO so severe-sepsis R65.20/.21→R65.1, SIRS R65.10→R65.2).
  `icd-10.yaml` is now 100% WHO format. Structural guards: `test_jp_never_emits_cm_granular_code`,
  `test_icd10_who_file_has_no_cm_granular_codes`. Generation: 0 CM-granular codes emitted.
- [x] **engine.py differential codes registered — FIXED (PR #21).** The `DIFFERENTIALS` table +
  LR tuples in `modules/diagnosis/engine.py` are a third emittable Condition-code source; ~65
  codes were unregistered (prefix-fallback). Added after NLM/WHO verification (+58 CM, +58 WHO,
  +35 us_map, +2 jp_map incl. K56.9→K56.7). Coverage test now ranges over `ALL_EMITTABLE`
  (disease + encounter + engine.py). Generation (US 51k + JP 28k Conditions): 0 prefix-fallback.
- [ ] **engine.py diagnosis tables → YAML (data-driven, follow-up #2).** `DIFFERENTIALS`,
  `LR_TABLE`, `DIAGNOSIS_PROGRESSION` + display `name`s are hard-coded in Python (violates the
  YAML-driven AD). Move to `reference_data` YAML and resolve `name` via `clinosim.codes` lookup.
  Output-logic adjacent → must preserve determinism/golden output.
- [ ] **RxNorm / CPT / SNOMED / YJ / K-code** — authoritative-source comments added but codes
  not yet machine-verified (RxNorm verifiable via NLM RxNav API; others need licensed masters).
- [ ] **ECG as a proper diagnostic** (currently skipped from labs; model as Procedure/
  diagnostic order so the "ECG was done" fact is recorded).
- [x] **Acid-base model** (eval finding): pH/HCO3/pCO2 derived from a single `ph_status`
  axis couldn't distinguish metabolic vs respiratory acidosis or show correct compensation.
  **Fixed** with a two-axis model: `ph_status` (disturbance magnitude) + new
  `PhysiologicalState.respiratory_fraction` (0 = metabolic → HCO3, 1 = respiratory → pCO2).
  Blood gas now follows Henderson-Hasselbalch with partial compensation (Winter's for
  metabolic acidosis → Kussmaul low pCO2; ~0.35 mEq/mmHg renal compensation for respiratory
  acidosis → raised HCO3). Axis is **scenario/profile-driven** (same pattern as
  `causes_myocardial_injury`): disease `acid_base_type` field (`metabolic` default,
  `respiratory` for COPD/asthma) + chronic J44/J45 in `initialize_state`. Audited (pop 30k):
  DKA pCO2 34.8 (Kussmaul ✓), COPD HCO3 26.7 / pCO2 47.5 (compensation ✓). 6 unit tests.
- [ ] ED non-cardiac troponin now reflects cardiac comorbidity (median ~0.095, can exceed
  the 0.04 cutoff) — decide comorbidity-baseline vs rule-out-negative semantics.

### EHR data enrichment roadmap (AD-55 — Base vs Module)

> Benchmarked vs Synthea / USCDI v5 / MIMIC-IV. **Imaging/modality data out of scope**
> (CT/MRI/X-ray/US, echo, ECG tracings, endoscopy, spirometry, pathology) — see DESIGN §6.10.
> **Base** = always-on, extends core (`types`/`population`/`observation`/`simulator`/`output`).
> **Module** = opt-in, **one theme per module** (same pattern as `identity`).
> Cross-cutting for all: types in `types/`, module-independence (deps in README),
> deterministic sub-seed, FHIR built in `output` reading CIF (modules stay output-agnostic).

#### Base — near-essential (always generated; extends existing core)

- [x] **Microbiology & susceptibility** — `observation/microbiology.py` + `types/microbiology.py` + `observation/reference_data/microbiology.yaml` (all codes data-driven). Emits FHIR `DiagnosticReport` + `Specimen` + `Observation` via the AD-56 builder registry; CSV `microbiology.csv`. Sepsis/pneumonia/UTI/cellulitis/aspiration cohort. Encounter-scoped sub-seed (main stream unperturbed). 10 unit tests. `# TODO: verify` SNOMED/LOINC codes + antibiogram rates vs authoritative sources.
- [~] **Blood-based markers**: cardiac troponin + CK-MB **done** — `physiology` derives Troponin_I/CK_MB (ACS flag `causes_myocardial_injury` on the disease scenario → MI-level; other cardiac dysfunction → mild type-2; CKD confounder via renal; sex-specific cutoff). Lab order-name aliases (`observation/reference_data/lab_aliases.yaml`) canonicalize stat/serial/variant orders across inpatient/ED/outpatient; FHIR uses canonical name → LOINC resolves. Lactate already worked. **ABG panel (pH/pCO2/pO2/HCO3 from one "ABG" order) + pO2 deferred** — needs panel-expansion (one order → multiple results), tracked under AD-57.
  - [x] JP JLAC10 codes for Troponin_I (5C094) / CK_MB (3B015) verified vs JSLM master v137.
    Serial-troponin intra-day trend still open.
- [ ] **`DiagnosticReport` grouping** — `output` adapter (+ `types/output`): group lab Observations into panels (CBC/BMP/LFT). Structural fidelity, no new clinical data.
- [x] **Nursing flowsheets** — `observation/nursing.py` (純粋関数 NEWS2/GCS/Braden/Morse) + `nursing_enricher.py` (AD-56 Base post_records, 専用 hashlib サブシード → メインストリーム不変)。CIF: `VitalSignRecord.news2_score`/`gcs_score` + `NursingRiskAssessment` (Braden 6 サブスケール + Morse)。FHIR `category=survey` Observation 7 件 (NLM 照合済み LOINC: GCS 9269-2, Braden 38227-5, Morse 59460-6, Barthel 96761-2, 輸液 9108-2/9192-6/9262-7; NEWS2 は権威 LOINC なし → `code.text` のみ)。CSV: `nursing_risk.csv` 新規 + `vital_signs.csv` に NEWS2/GCS 列追加。thresholds はすべて `reference_data/nursing_scores.yaml` データ駆動。
- [x] **Immunization history** — `modules/immunization/engine.py` (純粋関数 `load_schedule`/`generate_immunizations`) + `enricher.py` (AD-56 Base post_records, 専用 hashlib サブシード 0x494D → メインストリーム不変, AD-16)。CVX コード 10 件を CDC IIS で照合済み (`codes/data/cvx.yaml`、FHIR URI `http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/cvx`)。US adult schedule 5 ワクチン (Influenza/COVID-19/PPSV23/Tdap/Zoster-RZV) + JP 3 ワクチン (Influenza/COVID-19/PPSV23)。各ワクチンは `available_from` + `coverage_by_age_sex` (年齢帯×性別 接種率) 付き。AS-OF = snapshot_date または最新入院日 (AD-32)。CIF: `ImmunizationRecord` (vaccine_cvx/occurrence_date/status/primary_source)。FHIR R4 `Immunization` (US英語/JP日本語 display)。CSV: `immunizations.csv`。接種率出典: CDC FluVaxView/MMWR (US), MHLW 接種率統計 (JP) — 概数モデリングパラメータ。
- [x] **Family history** — `modules/family_history/` (engine 純粋関数 + `reference_data/family_history.yaml` 遺伝倍率/続柄) + `locale/{us,jp}/family_history_prevalence.yaml` (国別有病率)。AD-56 post_records enricher (person_id サブシード 0x4648 → メインストリーム不変, AD-16)。本人 chronic_conditions × locale 有病率 × 遺伝倍率で第1度近親 (母 MTH/父 FTH/兄弟姉妹 NSIB) の疾患を合成。心血管代謝系 (E11/I10/I25/I63/I64/E78) + 主要がん (C50/C18/C34/C61、性別制限)。FHIR `FamilyMemberHistory` (v3-RoleCode + ICD)、CSV `family_history.csv`。`CIFPatientRecord.family_history` typed field。PR #63。
- [x] **Code status / resuscitation status** — `modules/code_status/` + `locale/{us,jp}/code_status_rates.yaml`。AD-56 post_records enricher (encounter_id サブシード 0x4353 → 主乱数列不変)。4 段階 (Full Code/DNR/DNR+DNI/Comfort)、入院=全例 + ED=`deceased`/`icu_transferred` のみ + 外来=なし。年齢×acuity (terminal>icu>routine) で確率割当。FHIR survey `Observation` (SNOMED resuscitation-status)、CSV `code_status.csv`。`CIFPatientRecord.code_status`。SNOMED は環境制約で `# TODO: verify`。PR #64。
- [x] **Extended SDOH (smoking/alcohol/JP 要介護度)** — 喫煙 (US Core Smoking Status, LOINC 72166-2 + SNOMED) と飲酒 (LOINC 11331-6) を social-history `Observation` 化 (既存属性を読むだけ)。JP **要介護度** は新規 `modules/care_level/` (JP-only post_records enricher, person_id サブシード 0x434C, 年齢駆動) + `jp-care-level` ローカルコード体系 (MHLW 介護保険 区分)。新 `modules/output/_fhir_sdoh.py` (3 builder)、CSV `care_level.csv` + `alcohol_use` 列。`CIFPatientRecord.care_level`。alcohol SNOMED は `# TODO: verify`。PR #65。

#### Modules — specialized / optional (opt-in, one theme each)

- [ ] **`modules/billing/`** — country-pluggable レセプト/claims (JP **DPC** per-diem bundling / US `Claim`+`ExplanationOfBenefit`). Mirrors `identity`: provider registry, deps `types`/`codes`/`locale`, reads CIF, FHIR in `output`, `--billing` flag. **Supersedes the v0.5 "DPC/DRG cost data" item.**
- [ ] **`modules/device/`** — device placement (central line / urinary catheter / ventilator / telemetry) + **HAI risk** (CLABSI/CAUTI/VAP) from dwell time; deps `procedure`/`types`; emit `Device`/`DeviceUseStatement` (+ HAI `Condition`). Flag-gated.
- [ ] **`modules/care_coordination/`** — `CarePlan`/`CareTeam`/`Goal` for USCDI/Synthea interoperability completeness; deps `types`; reads CIF; flag-gated.

Suggested order: ~~microbiology+markers~~ ✅ → ~~nursing flowsheets~~ ✅ → ~~immunization~~ ✅ → ~~family-history~~ ✅ → ~~code-status~~ ✅ → ~~extended SDOH (要介護度)~~ ✅ → `DiagnosticReport` grouping → `modules/billing` (JP DPC) → `modules/device` → `modules/care_coordination`. **AD-55 Base roadmap complete** (only `DiagnosticReport` panel grouping remains, structural-only).

## Future design improvements (tracked, not scheduled)

| # | Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-1 | encounter YAML-ization (workflow as data) | Medium | v0.2 |
| F-2 | clinical_course absorption into physiology | Low | Current separation works well |
| F-3 | DI/Registry pattern for module wiring | Low | Manual wiring is fine for now |
| F-4 | More languages in codes module (de, zh, ko, fr) | Low | Just add language keys to YAML entries |
| F-5 | UCUM module in codes/ for unit display translation | Low | Currently units are bare strings |
